  Stata commands are preprogrammed functions that take information we give to them, do something with the information, then output something. We pass information to commands with \textit{arguments} and \textit{options}.

  If you are not sure how to use a command you can get help by typing "help" and then the name of the command. For example,
  \begin{verbatim} help regress \end{verbatim}
  will take you to the regress command's \href{http://www.stata.com/manuals13/rregress.pdf}{manual}
